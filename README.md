# e-text v-0.5.0

***Markdown editor with encrypting capabilities***

### Why *e-text*?

**e-text** stands for enctypted text. In the beginning the project was meant to be a simple text editor with encrypting 
capabilites.

After tinkering with the editor, markdown became a better alternative as it's almost as readable as text (or more as it 
gives context) and can be rendered as HTML.

### Build Setup

# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:9080
npm run dev
